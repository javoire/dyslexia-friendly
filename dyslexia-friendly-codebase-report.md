## Current Best Practices (2024) vs Implementation

### ‚úÖ **What We're Doing Right**
- Using sans-serif fonts (Open Dyslexic, Comic Sans)
- Left-aligned text (avoiding justified text)
- High contrast options
- Alternating paragraph backgrounds
- Simple, clean interface

### ‚ùå **What We're Missing**
- **Font size flexibility** (12-14pt minimum recommended, we're fixed at 14px)
- **Background color options** (off-white, cream, soft pastels)
- **Proper line spacing controls** (1.5 spacing recommended)
- **Letter spacing customization** (35% of letter width optimal)
- **Avoiding all caps text** (our code doesn't prevent this)

## Conclusion

The DyslexiaFriendly extension has a **solid foundation** with good core features, but there's significant room for improvement to match current accessibility best practices. The codebase is well-structured and modern, making it easy to implement the suggested enhancements.

**Top 3 priorities:**
1. **Expand font and typography options** with user controls
2. **Add background color themes** and dark mode support  
3. **Implement keyboard shortcuts** and better accessibility features

These improvements would transform the extension from a basic font-switcher into a comprehensive dyslexia-friendly reading tool that matches current research and user needs.
